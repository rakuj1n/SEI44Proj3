          “When two parties get to know and understand each other so well that a
          true relationship blossoms, they take the things they can do together
          to a whole new level. That’s true for organisations as well as
          individuals, and it gives me so much personal joy as well as
          professional pleasure to have SFS and Shaw colleagues working
          hand-in-glove to jointly curate and showcase cutting-edge
          international movie content on this exciting new platform. To me, this
          doesn’t replace physical cinema-going…..it extends and enhances the
          whole milieu of movie appreciation.”
