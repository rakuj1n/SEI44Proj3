        keep track of everything."

        attending to life priorities, these movies come and go even before you
        know it. "

        "Fret not. Shaw Showcase will offer a curated selection of some of the
        most-loved indie movies here. What’s more! Grab your blankets and get
        scared silly with our specially selected horror titles. "
        <p />
        "And yes, we heard you. You could now rent each title starting from
        $4.99 and watch it from the comfort of your couch."
        <p />
        "So look out for more titles in the coming months."
